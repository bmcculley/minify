# Minify CSS with Python


A small python script that currently minifies and combines CSS files

The idea of this project is to keep from having to install a complicated
solution. If you don't need to do this operation often, this is the perfect
option.



An example usage:

```python cssmin.py -o new.min.css bootstrap.css bootstrap-theme.css elusive-webfont.css```
